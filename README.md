# Get Started
1. Start the Lucca Face Game
2. Wait for the "Go" page
3. Open the Developper Console
4. Copy-Past [this code](./LuccaFacesSolver.js)
5. It should start of its own, if not, then there may have been some updates...

# Technical

For a more technical explatation, the small JS code will learn to remember all your teammates after few automatic try and retry. To be fast, the script didn't associate the picture to a name, but just its metadata (size, image format) assuming there will be no collisions ðŸ¤ž
